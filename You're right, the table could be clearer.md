You're right, the table could be clearer, and your questions about CPU vs. GPU are excellent. Let's make a better table and address the CPU/GPU tradeoffs.

**Improved Reference Table:**

This table focuses on calculating memory requirements, and I've added a column for a 7B model, which is a common size. I've also added some common quantization methods.

| Quantization | Bits/Parameter | Bytes/Parameter | 1B Model Size | 7B Model Size | Example Libraries/Formats |
|----------------|----------------|-----------------|---------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Unquantized (FP32) | 32             | 4               | 4 GB          | 28 GB         | PyTorch (original models)    |
| Unquantized (FP16/BF16) | 16             | 2               | 2 GB          | 14 GB         | PyTorch, Transformers      |
| Q8_0 (8-bit)      | 8              | 1               | 1 GB          | 7 GB          | GGUF, llama.cpp             |
| Q6_K (6-bit) | 6 | 0.75        | 0.75 GB         | 5.25 GB         |  GGUF, llama.cpp           |
| Q5_K_M (5-bit) | 5 | 0.625     |   0.625 GB         |      4.375 GB        | GGUF, llama.cpp               |
| Q4_K_M (4-bit)      | 4              | 0.5             | 0.5 GB        | 3.5 GB        | GGUF, llama.cpp, AutoGPTQ   |
| Q3_K_M (3-bit) | 3 | 0.375        | 0.375 GB         | 2.625 GB         |  GGUF, llama.cpp           |
| Q2_K (2-bit) | 2 | 0.25        | 0.25 GB         | 1.75 GB         | GGUF, llama.cpp           |

**Explanation of the Table Columns:**

*   **Quantization:**  The name of the quantization method.  "Q" usually stands for "quantized," followed by the number of bits. The "\_K" and "\_M" suffixes in GGUF refer to specific implementation details of the quantization.
*   **Bits/Parameter:**  How many bits are used to represent each parameter (weight) in the model.
*   **Bytes/Parameter:**  The number of bits converted to bytes (bits / 8). This is what we use for the size calculation.
*   **1B Model Size:**  The approximate memory required for a 1-billion parameter model with that quantization.
*   **7B Model Size:**  The approximate memory required for a 7-billion parameter model.
*   **Example Libraries/Formats**: Common tools and file formats associated with each quantization level. GGUF is the format used by `llama.cpp`. AutoGPTQ is another popular quantization method/tool, often used with the Transformers library.

**How to Use the Table:**

1.  **Find the quantization:** Determine how the model you want to use is quantized (e.g., Q4_K_M). You'll usually find this information where you download the model (Hugging Face, etc.).
2.  **Find the model size in parameters:** Determine the number of parameters in the model (e.g., 1B, 7B, 13B, 70B).
3.  **Read the size:**  Find the corresponding row and column to get the approximate memory requirement.

**CPU vs. GPU (Why Use a GPU?):**

You're absolutely right that RAM is cheaper than GPU VRAM. The reason to use a GPU (even an eGPU) comes down to *speed*â€”specifically, the massive parallelism of GPUs.

*   **Speed, Speed, Speed:**  GPUs are designed for massively parallel processing.  LLM inference involves a *huge* number of matrix multiplications.  GPUs can perform thousands of these operations *simultaneously*, while CPUs are much more limited in their parallelism.
* It may be helpful to think of a CPU as a single, highly skilled chef working in a kitchen. The chef is very fast, but still limited to how many dishes they can create at a time, even if they are the best chef in the world. A GPU, on the other hand, is like a large group of line cooks. They are efficient at doing their individual, specialized jobs and when working together, can produce exponentially more dishes.

*   **Quantifiable Difference:**  The speed difference is not small; it's often *orders of magnitude*.  A model that takes, say, 10 seconds to generate a response on a CPU might take less than 1 second on a GPU (or even faster with a good GPU).  This difference makes interactive use (like chatting) *much* more practical on a GPU.

*   **Why not *just* save CPU usage?**  It's not primarily about saving CPU usage; it's about *achieving acceptable performance*.  Running a large LLM on a CPU is often so slow that it's not really usable for interactive applications.  You *could* use the CPU, but you'd be waiting a long time for each response.

* **Memory Bandwidth:** Another critical factor is *memory bandwidth*.  GPUs have much higher memory bandwidth than CPUs. This means they can move data between memory and the processing units much faster.  LLM inference involves constantly moving data (parameters, activations) back and forth, so high bandwidth is essential for good performance.

**In Summary:**

*   **RAM is cheaper than VRAM.**
*   **Running LLMs on CPU uses RAM.**
*   **GPUs are *dramatically* faster than CPUs for LLM inference due to their parallel processing capabilities and higher memory bandwidth.** This speed difference is the primary reason to use a GPU, even though it's more expensive.
*   **CPU inference is viable for smaller models or situations where speed is not critical.** But for larger models and interactive use, a GPU is almost essential for a good experience.
* Use the table by figuring out the number of parameters of your model, the method of quantization, and then multiplying those numbers together.

The table and this explanation should give you a much clearer, more practical reference for understanding LLM memory requirements and the CPU/GPU tradeoff.
